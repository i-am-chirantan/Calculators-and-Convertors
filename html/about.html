                        Profitability Ratios Calculator will find solutions for up to four measures of the profitability of a business or organization - return on assets, return on equity, gross profit margin, operating profit margin, net profit margin, earnings per share, and
                        price/earnings (P/E) ratio. The calculator can calculate one or two sets of data points, and will only give results for those ratios that can be calculated based on the inputs provided by the user. • If you are analyzing one company
                        over a single reporting period, fill in the known data points in column A and press calculate - the results will display below. • If you are analyzing two companies or a single company over two reporting periods, use both column
                        A (primary) and B (secondary). For each data point and ratio that has a value in both columns, the change expressed as a percent increase or decrease will also be calculated. The significant figures drop select box only determines
                        rounding for the ratios themselves. Percent changes are always calculated to four significant figures. Calculations Used in this Calculator • Return on Assets = net income ÷ total assets • Return on Equity = net income ÷ shareholder's
                        equity • Gross Profit Margin = gross profit ÷ sales • Operating Profit Margin = operating profit ÷ sales • Net Profit Margin = net income ÷ sales • Earnings per Share = net income ÷ common stock outstanding • Price/ Earnings Ratio
                        = market price per share ÷ (net income ÷ common stock outstanding)</p>
